for stemming.php, the source code is from :

INTRUDUCTION:
The Porter Stemming Algorithm was developed by Martin Porter for reducing English words to their word stems.
For example, the word “connections” would be reduced to its stem form “connect.”


IMPORTANCE:
Stemmer->stem(word) , the parameter is a word , instead of a sentence.
( I know that in our assignment, we put a sentence as a parameter )
